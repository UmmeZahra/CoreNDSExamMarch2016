Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

    why do we need data structure?
Ans:Data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
  Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.
  Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.
    List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans: Array, ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, HashMap, HasTable, Graph
    what is an Array?
Ans:An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.
    what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: array is a collection of similar type of data and the capacity of array is fixed and it define with in system name pace
    array list it hold different type of data and the capacity of arraylist is increase dynamically .
    what is LinkedList?
Ans: A linked list is a linear dynamic data structure where each element is a separate object and that can grow and shrink during itâ€™s execution time.
    what is queue?
Ans: A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
New additions to a line made to the back of the queue, while removal (or serving) happens in the front.
    what is stack?
Ans: A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
    what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: first-in first-out (FIFO)
     last-in first-out (LIFO)
    what is the order of complexity?
Ans:
    what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans:
    what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans:
    what is tree in data structure?
Ans: A tree data structure is a powerful tool for organizing data objects based on keys. It is equally useful for organizing multiple data objects in terms of hierarchical relationships .
     The node at the top is the root, the tree's ``starting point.'' The arcs between nodes are called branches. A node that has no branches underneath it is called a leaf. Real trees grow from their root upwards to the sky, but computer-science trees grow from the root downwards.
     Trees can hold objects that are sorted by their keys. The nodes are ordered so that all keys in a node's left subtree are less than the key of the object at the node, and all keys in a node's right subtree are greater than the key of the object at the node.
    what is graph in data structure?
Ans: A graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics. A graph data structure consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.
    what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans:
    What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans:
    How HashMap works in java?
Ans:
    What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans:
    What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans:
    What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans:
    What is DFS and BFS?
Ans:
    What is Recursion?
Ans:
    What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans:
    Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
