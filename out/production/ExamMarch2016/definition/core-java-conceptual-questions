Please answer the below core-java Questions:


    What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans: JDK--> Java Development kit
    Components of jdk--->[java,javac,debug,javap,jre,jvm]
    What is IDE?
Ans: IDE--->Integrated Development Environment
    What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans: eclips ,intellij, bluej, Netbeans
    Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans: Java compiler compiles the code and produce byte code and byte code get loded to the JVM and produce signal and operating system r receive the signal and performs accordingly
    what is class?
Ans: Class is the blueprint of an object.
    What is object?
Ans: Object is an instance of the class . An object is a location in memory having a value and referenced by an identifier.
    What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: main method will be the entry point of an application.
    Why main is static?
Ans:In Java program's main method has to be declared static because keyword static allows main to be called without creating an object of the class in which the main method is defined.
    What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans:Interface support multiple inheritance
    Abstract class don’t support multiple inheritance
    Interface Doesn’t contain data member
    Abstract class contain data member
    Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans: Java don’t allow to make an Object from an Interface but it allow us to create object  from an Abstract class , so we have to implement the abstract method from interface in the Abstract class to use it. However those object always refer to the concrete class where the Abstract class has been extended.
    what is Access Specifier?
Ans:Access Specifiers regulate access to classes, fields and methods in Java.These Specifiers determine whether a field or method in a class, can be used or invoked by another method in another class or sub-class. Access Specifiers can be used to restrict access. Access Specifiers are an integral part of object-oriented programming.
    What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans:OOP = object oriented programming
    Abstraction is implementation hiding.
    Encapsulation is data hiding.
    Inheritance is the capability of a class to use the properties and methods of another class while adding its own functionality. Java uses the extends keyword to set the relationship between a super class and a object class.
    Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In programming languages polymorphism is the capability of an action or method to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon.
    What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans:API = application program interface
    Does java support multiple inheritance?
Ans: No, Java support inheritance one class at a time.However it support support multiple inheritance in case of Interface.
    What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name, if their argument lists are different.Overloading happens at compile-time
    What is method overriding and when it happens?
Ans: Method Overriding is achieved when a subclass overrides non-static methods defined in the superclass, following which the new method implementation in the subclass that is executed.Overriding happens at runtime.
    Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans:
    What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans:
    What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans:
    What is final, finally and finalize?
Ans: Final:final is a keyword. the variable declared as final should be initialized only once and cannot be changed. java classes declared as final cannot be extended.Methods declared as final cannot be overridden.
     Finally: finally is a block. The finally block always executes when the try block exits. This ensures that the finally block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs. But finally is useful for more than just exception handling - it allows the programmer to avoid having cleanup code accidentally bypassed by a return, continue, or break. Putting cleanup code in a finally block is always a good practice, even when no exceptions are anticipated.
     Finalize: finalize is a method. Before an object is garbage collected, the runtime system calls its finalize() method. You can write system resources release code in finalize() method before getting garbage collected.
    What is a constructor ?
Ans:A constructor is a bit of code that allows us to create objects from a class. Constructor is use to initialize the object .
    What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans:
    What is "super" keyword in java?
Ans:
    What is JVM stand for ?
Ans: JVM  = Java Virtual Machine
    What version of java are you using?
Ans: java version "1.8.0_73"
    What is JAR stand for ?
Ans: JAR = Java Archive
    What is compile time and run time?
Ans: In order to create a program, a developer first writes source code, which defines how the program will function. The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program. This compilation process is referred to as compile time. A compiled program can be opened and run by a user. When an application is running, it is called runtime.
    What is heap?
Ans: The JVM has a heap that is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays are allocated. It is created at the JVM start-up.
    How java manage it's memory?
Ans: Memory management is the process of allocating new objects and removing unused objects to make space for those new object allocations. This section presents some basic memory management concepts and explains the basics about object allocation and garbage collection in the Oracle JRockit JVM. The following topics are covered:
     The Heap and the Nursery
     Object Allocation
     Garbage Collection
    What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Ans: 1) The String object is immutable in Java but StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable objects.
     2) StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not which makes StringBuilder faster than StringBuffer.
     3) Concatenation operator "+" is internally implemented using either StringBuffer or StringBuilder.
     4) Use String if you require immutability, use StringBuffer in java if you need mutable + thread-safety and use StringBuilder in Java if you require mutable + without thread-safety.
